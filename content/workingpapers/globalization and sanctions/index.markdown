## Abstract

This project's primary objective is to provide a clear illustration of how economic sanctions function within a globalized context. It specifically delves into the impact of globalization on the use and success of economic sanctions, employing a stylized game-theoretic model to depict the dynamics between the sender and the target and their resulting outcomes.
