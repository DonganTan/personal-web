## Abstract

While economic sanctions have received considerable attention regarding their initiation, success, and consequences, the termination of sanctions and its determinants have only recently garnered attention. Equally significant is the understudied area of understanding the aftermath of sanctions removal. This paper investigates how countries recover after the lifting of economic sanctions and the factors influencing the speed and quality of this recovery. Specifically, we examine the transformation of the welfare of target countries post-sanctions relief, considering factors such as the characteristics of sanctions, target country attributes, and sender country dynamics. Utilizing the Global Sanctions Database covering 1,325 sanctions cases from 1950 to 2022, our analysis underscores that the pace and extent of welfare recovery hinge on variables including the duration, scope, and type of sanctions, the strength of the pre-sanction economy, and domestic political dynamics. This research sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of post-sanction welfare recovery, providing valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners navigating the complexities of sanctions regimes.
