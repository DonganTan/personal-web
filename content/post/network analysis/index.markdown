title: The Impact of Economic Sanctions on International Trade - Evidence From Network Analysis

## Abstract

This study investigates the impact of economic sanctions on a target country’s global trade using network analysis. It contributes to existing literature by (1) capturing the complexity of trade relationships beyond conventional bilateral trade flows, and (2) quantifying a country’s position and influence in international trade. Economic sanctions disrupt the target’s trade network by undermining its partnerships, reachability, and bridging capacity. They reduce the target’s trade partners by limiting market access and deterring potential partners due to fear of retaliation. Disrupted trade routes lead to delays, rerouting, and increased logistical expenses, diminishing the target’s reachability. Sanctions also erode trust and demand among reliant countries, reducing the target’s bridging role. Empirical findings from 158 countries between 1950 and 2014 strongly support this theory. A case study of Iran illustrates that while the initial repercussions of sanctions are substantial, the target can employ strategies to mitigate their long-term impact.
