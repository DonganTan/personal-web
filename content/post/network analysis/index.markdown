## Abstract

This paper investigates how economic sanctions affect international trade using a network analysis approach. At the global level, as the number of economic sanctions increases, the density of the global trade network will decrease due to the increased uncertainty and risk of international economic conditions, and the asymmetry of the global trade network will increase due to the emergence of two competing groups on the sender's and target's sides of the global market. At the national level, economic sanctions, designed to restrict the target's international transactions, will increase the inherent uncertainty and risk regarding the security and profitability of trading with the target, thereby reducing the target's trade ties with other nations. Moreover, the negative effects of sanctions on the target's trade ties become more sizable as the target's political stability deteriorates. The sample includes bilateral trade flows between 162 countries from 1950 to 2014. Empirical findings are largely consistent with the national expectations but not the global ones. Sanctioned nations tend to have lower scores for their trade network's degree, closeness, and betweenness than non-sanctioned states, and the negative impact of sanctions on the closeness and betweenness of trade networks is greater in democratic nations than in autocratic nations.
