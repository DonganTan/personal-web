## Abstract

While growing scholarly attention has been paid to the role of political leaders in their foreign policy choices, little is known about how political leadersâ€™ life experiences affect their decisions about economic sanctions. To fill the gap, this study examines how the personal backgrounds of political leaders influence their foreign policy choices regarding economic sanctions. We argue that political leaders with prior experience of military backgrounds use more sanctions than those without such experience. We theorize that leaders with prior military experience become more aware of the utility of coercive foreign policy and become more supportive of using economic sanctions against other countries. Combining the Leader Experience and Attitude Descriptions data set and the Threat and Imposition of Sanctions data between 1946 and 2004, we find that political leaders with prior military service but no combat experience in their youth are more likely to use the threat to impose economic sanctions. This paper contributes to the growing literature on the interaction between domestic politics and foreign policy by introducing the role of political leaders.
