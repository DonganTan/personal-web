## Abstract

This study employs the two-stage difference-in-differences (2sDiD) estimator to investigate the causal effect of economic sanctions on political stability. It contributes to existing research by (1) re-evaluating the impact of sanctions on political stability using newly introduced causal inference methods, and (2) distinguishing the effects of sanctions across different political regimes and economic globalization levels. The paper argues that economic sanctions impose economic hardships on the target population, leading to public frustration towards their governments, which acts as a political stimulus, encouraging political mobilization activities and thereby decreasing the country’s political stability. However, this mechanism depends on the target’s political regime and level of economic globalization. Sanctions hurt democracies more than autocracies because autocratic regimes can suppress public dissent through repression and face higher opportunity costs for anti-government actions. Moreover, economic globalization gives targets additional alternatives to sanctioned products and services, which may weaken sanctions and negatively damage political stability in low-globalized targets more than in high-globalized ones. Empirical findings, based on 9,231 country-year observations between 1949 and 2022, largely align with the theoretical framework, showing that economic sanctions undermine the target’s political stability, with these destabilizing effects being conditional on its political regime and economic globalization levels.
