## Abstract

Much research has studied causes and consequences of economic sanctions. While economic sanctions such as trade, financial, and investment sanctions have gathered scholarly attention, few studies have investigated the unique determinants of military sanctions. Given that economic sanctions are often ineffective and costly to the sender, an increasing number of countries are focusing their attention on the use of military sanctions. We argue that military sanctions are likely to be used as a substitute for and a complement to economic sanctions when the latter are expected to be incapable of changing the target behavior. We also contend that military sanctions become a viable foreign policy option when the targeted country requires external military assistance to address internal and external security challenges. Utilizing both dyadic and monadic sanctions data spanning from 1946 to 2022, our findings reveal that economic sanctions tend to be supplanted or integrated with military sanctions under circumstances where economic measures are anticipated to be both ineffective and costly. Furthermore, our results indicate that military sanctions are more inclined to be employed when the targeted regime finds itself in a state of insecurity and lacks ample military resources at its disposal.
