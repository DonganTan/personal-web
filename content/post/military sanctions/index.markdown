## Abstract

Sanctions have long served as pivotal foreign policy instruments in international relations, yet while economic sanctions have been extensively studied, military sanctions remain relatively unexplored. This paper argues for the importance of scrutinizing military sanctions for several reasons: they represent a significant portion of sanctions and have shown an upward trend since the 20th century; the simultaneous use of different sanction types poses challenges in aggregating their effects; and globalization has enabled targets to evade economic embargoes by engaging in trade with third countries, prompting the exploration of alternative sanction methods. This study marks an initial endeavor to highlight the growing significance of military sanctions and identify three distinct determinants of their implementation: the target's reliance on military resources, the sender's military capabilities, and foreign policy similarity between states. Empirical evidence from 1951 to 2010 reveals that the target's military resources reliance and the sender's military capabilities increase the likelihood of employing military sanctions, while greater foreign policy similarity reduces it. This research paves the way for further exploration into the strategic use of military sanctions and their potential synergies with economic sanctions, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of this diplomatic tool.
