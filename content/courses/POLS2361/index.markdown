### Course Description

International politics is a fascinating and constantly evolving field that explores the interactions between nations, non-state actors, and international organizations. In this course, we will examine the fundamental concepts, theories, and issues that shape the contemporary global system.

Through lectures, readings, discussions, and assignments, we will analyze international relations through the framework of "interests, interactions, and institutions." We will explore a wide range of topics, including the nature of power and security, war and peace, international political economy, transnational politics, and global challenges. By the end of the course, you will have gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of international politics and developed critical thinking and analytical skills to analyze global issues.
